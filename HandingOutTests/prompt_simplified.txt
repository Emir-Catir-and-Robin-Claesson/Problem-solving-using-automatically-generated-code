Given a list of students and distances between each pair of students, finds the shortest path that passes every student no more than once and both starts and returns to the student numbered 1.
The input will be given to standard input in this order: The first row contains the total number of students. The following rows, one for each pair of students, contain three numbers separated by spaces where the first number is the student ID for a student, the second number is the ID for another student and the third number is the distance between the two students.
The output should be printed to standard output in this order: The first row should contain the total distance traveled. The second row should be the path that the teacher should take, consisting of the student IDs in the order the teacher should walk, where each student ID is separated by a space.
